This idea of a watery underworld is supported by\n                  observing the geographic characteristics of the Maya\n                  environment. Some of the world’s longest cave systems are\n                  found in the Yucatan Peninsula, and one of the features of the\n                  topography of the peninsula are cenotes, or natural pits that\n                  can form and expose pools of water beneath the ground.\n                  <ProjectImage\n                    img={cenotes}\n                    alt='Cenotes in the Yucatan Peninsula'\n                    cite='Cenotes in the Yucatan Peninsula'\n                  />\n                  These pits and caves throughout the Maya landscape may have\n                  been believed to be entrances to the underworld. In this way,\n                  the stories about the underworld in a watery, dark state may\n                  stem from a symbolic connection to what was believed to be the\n                  supernatural nature of these caves and cenotes by the ancient\n                  inhabitants of the Yucatan Peninsula.\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  <Heading as={'h3'} size={'md'} pt={6}>\n                    Cycles of Time in the Night Sky{' '}\n                  </Heading>\n                  The Maya upperworld corresponded to the sky and, like other\n                  cultures around the world, they observed what happened in the\n                  sky and created mythologies based on these motions. They\n                  envisioned the dome of the sky as a ‘cosmic mirror’ that\n                  reflected processes on earth. Maya art, architecture, pottery,\n                  and culture was like a mapping of the heavens, and they\n                  recreated their observations of the sky upon the earth.\n                  <br /> <br />\n                  The Maya believed in the idea that life and death were\n                  cyclical processes, and likened them to their understanding of\n                  the seasons, calendars, astronomical, and agricultural cycles.\n                  <br /> <br />\n                  <Center py={6}>\n                    <iframe\n                      width='560'\n                      height='315'\n                      src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/fwtQpsUrI8I'\n                      title='YouTube video player'\n                      frameborder='0'\n                      allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture'\n                      allowfullscreen\n                    ></iframe>\n                  </Center>\n                  The Maya had a dynamic view of time, and they observed great\n                  cycles of time in the motions of the sky and stars. Their\n                  cosmology influenced their mythology and their ritual life as\n                  it was believed that the things that happened in the sky were\n                  a macrocosm of the processes on earth and those happening in\n                  the underworld. Exploring Maya cosmology further requires us\n                  to look at the Popol Vuh for clues about the significance of\n                  their rituals and mythology.\n                </Box>\n              </AccordionPanel>\n            </AccordionItem>\n\n            <AccordionItem>\n              <h2>\n                <AccordionButton>\n                  <Box flex='1' textAlign='left' fontSize='xl'>\n                    The <i>Popol Vuh</i>\n                  </Box>\n                  <AccordionIcon />\n                </AccordionButton>\n              </h2>\n              <AccordionPanel pb={4}>\n                <Stack spacing={6}>\n                  <Box\n                    p={2}\n                    fontWeight={'light'}\n                    fontSize={'md'}\n                    boxShadow={'md'}\n                    rounded={'md'}\n                  >\n                    <Heading as={'h3'} size={'md'} py={3}>\n                      The <i>Popol Vuh</i>\n                    </Heading>\n                    The Popol Vuh is a 16th century text from the K’iche’ Maya\n                    people of highland Guatemala. This text was preserved\n                    through oral tradition in the Pre-Colombian era and recorded\n                    in writing by the K’iche’ Maya in 1550 C.E. The Popol Vuh\n                    encompasses a range of subjects that include creation,\n                    ancestry, history, and Maya cosmology. Understanding the\n                    Mayan creation myth allows us to make educated inferences\n                    about what spiritual life and culture was like in their\n                    civilization and better understand the ways in which the\n                    Mayans experienced their world.\n                    <br /> <br />\n                    The text itself has undergone at least 13 different\n                    translations and has been influenced by the Spanish\n                    Catholics that oversaw its commitment to writing, but it\n                    still retains much of its legitimacy as the foundational\n                    creation and mythological narrative of the Maya. There are a\n                    few key ideas we can derive from the Popol Vuh that help us\n                    to see the world as the Maya did, these are the Maya\n                    creation myth, the idea of Xibalba or the “underworld”, and\n                    the description of the Maya universe as being inside a\n                    cyclical process where life, death, and rebirth continually\n                    repeat. The Popol Vuh also introduces us to ideas such as\n                    sacrifice and ancestral energy, which will be important\n                    later in our understanding of Maya ritual life and kingship.\n                    <Heading as={'h3'} size={'md'} py={3}>\n                      The Maya Creation Myth\n                    </Heading>\n                    Part One of the Popol Vuh in the translation by Denis\n                    Tedlock deals with Maya creation.
