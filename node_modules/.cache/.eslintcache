The king had all to\n        say and lived a very luxurious lifestyle. Mayan Kings lived in stone\n        palaces within the city which were either a part of or near temples. The\n        palace of Palenque is a great example of this. It served as the\n        residence for the legendary King Pakal the Great as well as many other\n        kings below him. The king also had a multitude of servants to look after\n        him and accompany his every need. The king was very busy ruling the\n        Mayan empire, however occasionally he would go out into society and\n        watch a sports match or indulge in theater however this was somewhat\n        rare.\n        <ProjectImage\n          img={palanque}\n          alt={'Palenque'}\n          cite='Maya Palace of Pakal at Palenque'\n        />\n        <Heading size={'lg'} color='blue.600'>\n          The Elites\n        </Heading>\n        Right below the king were the elites. These were extremely wealthy\n        people who would be considered akin to modern day billionaires.\n        Oftentimes government jobs were the ones which the elites had. These\n        included vocations such as a priest, military leaders, farmers, scribes,\n        mathematicians, astronomers, tax collectors or a slave traders.\n        <br /> <br />\n        They still did live in large luxurious palace-like homes although they\n        were not nearly as luxurious as the king’s. The elites also did have a\n        multitude of servants and slaves to not only wait on their domestic\n        needs but to also perform laborious activities which their jobs\n        entailed. For example if an elite happened to be a farmer they would\n        have their employees and slaves tend to the crops and do the laborous\n        work while the elite’s job was mainly to sell those products which the\n        farm produced.\n        <ProjectImage\n          img={mansion}\n          alt={'Elite Maya Home'}\n          cite={'Elite Maya Home'}\n        />\n        This is a good example of what an elite Mayan house looked like. They\n        were lucky enough to live in sprawling palace-like homes. Like modern\n        mega-mansions, the Mayan elites also had guest houses and separate wings\n        of their mansion where their slaves and servants resided to wait on\n        their every need.\n        <ProjectImage\n          img={court}\n          alt={'maya ballcourt'}\n          cite={'Maya ballcourt'}\n        />\n        This is a picture of the arena in which sports games were played. The\n        elites also participated in entertainment. They would often times go out\n        into society to watch a sports game where they’d watch players compete\n        in games which were similar to modern day soccer, kickball and baseball.\n        However, this wasn’t the only form of entertainment. Mayan elites would\n        attend dances in which the elites danced while others played music, they\n        would go to theater and like modern day elites, they would attend\n        soirees and fete-like gatherings. The elites oftentimes went out into\n        society and had a lot of fun.\n        <ProjectImage\n          img={calender}\n          alt={'maya calender'}\n          cite='This is the Mayan calendar which was developed and created by ancient Mayan astrologers and artists.'\n        />\n        Due to the fact that society valued math and astrology the Mayans were\n        able to have a very advanced astrological system as well as make very\n        important discoveries in Math. The Mayan calendar is extremely important\n        as well as their discovery of the number zero. It could be argued if\n        Mayan society didn’t value this form of intellectualism these\n        advancements wouldn’t have been made.\n        <Heading size={'lg'} color='red.600' pt={6}>\n          The Merchants\n        </Heading>\n        Right below the elites was the merchant class. The merchant class sort\n        of acted as a middling class for the Mayans. However, these people were\n        incredibly well off. They would be considered the equivalent of people\n        who are high upper middle class or low upper class by our standards\n        today. Some jobs which merchants held were merchants, farmers, artists,\n        arichtects and slave traders. It was very easy for someone who was born\n        into this social class to work their way up into the elite class. This\n        would often times be by expanding their business if they owned a farm of\n        were a slave trader or by getting invovled in math and astrology and\n        working their way.\n        <br /> <br />\n        People within the merchant class would often times have one or two\n        servants or slaves to attend to their domestic needs or help them work\n        on their farm. However, unlike the elite class they didn’t have a whole\n        fleet of servants or slaves to help them out. They would occasionally\n        attend sporting events or dances. It should be noted that unlike the\n        elite class they weren’t venturing out into society all of the time.\n        <ProjectImage\n          img={stone}\n          alt={'maya home'}\n          cite='Maya Merchant Class Home'\n        />\n        This is a good example of the type of house a member of the merchant\n        class lived in. As one can see it’s by no means a mansion but it’s a lot\n        nicer than what the average lower class Mayan lived in. They couldn’t\n        afford to have guest houses or separate wings for their house for their\n        domestic staff but they would often times have rooms in their house for\n        live in servants or slaves and a nice spacious house like how many high\n        upper middle class lower upper class people live today.\n        <Heading size={'lg'} color='green.600' pt={6}>\n          The Serfs\n        </Heading>\n        Below the merchant class was the surf class. Surfs did not live like\n        average middle class people. They oftentimes struggled to get by and to\n        put food on the table. Surfs would be the modern day equivalent of\n        working class or underclass people in modern society. Surfs oftentimes\n        worked on mining crops on a farm owned by an elite or a merchant, helped\n        to build houses and palaces by lifting very heavy stone or they worked\n        as servants. Surfs basically lived like modern day working class people.\n        They would work very, very hard all day long, oftentimes doing jobs\n        which society scoffed at or didn’t value and they would come home to\n        sleep and do it all over again. Being a servant in the peasant was a\n        pretty good job. Surfs could also never afford to go out into society\n        and see a sports game or go to dances.\n        <ProjectImage\n          img={home}\n          alt={'Maya Home'}\n          cite='This is a good example of a surf’s house. It was very, very small and it was a hut. And it only had one room where whole families would live. '\n        />\n        <Heading size={'lg'} color='orange.600'>\n          The Slaves\n        </Heading>\n        Below the surfs were slaves. Slavery was not at all similar to modern\n        day United States or Carribian slavery. Slavery was not based on race\n        nor was it generational. Slaves were often times children who grew up as\n        orphans and were never adapted by a different family, people who\n        committed some type of criminal offense such as stealing or murder or\n        people of captured territory. Sometimes people were forced into slavery\n        if they couldn’t pay off their debt. Sometimes people would even sell\n        themselves into slavery. This was because Mayan surfs were usually\n        pretty poor and had a hard time putting food on the table. Therefore, if\n        one member of the family sold themselves into slavery they could give\n        that money to the rest of the family so they could have a better chance\n        at surviving or moving upward in society. It’s also important to note\n        that slavery was not generational.\n        <br /> <br />\n        Although slaves in the Mayan empire had no rights or privileges, slave\n        owners were not nearly as brutal towards their property as more modern\n        day slave owners were to theirs. Basically there’s no evidence showing\n        that Mayan slaves were whipped, beaten or brutally killed. Although the\n        exact treatment of each slave probably vaired depending upon the person\n        who owned them there’s no strong evidence showing that slaves were\n        horribly abused or mistreated despite having no rights.\n        <ProjectImage\n          img={farming}\n          alt={'Maya Slaves'}\n          cite={'This is a picture depicting Mayan slaves working on a farm. '}\n        />\n        <Heading size={'lg'}>Women in the Maya Empire</Heading>\n        Women have been oppressed in virtually all time periods and throughout\n        all cultures. The Mayan empire was no different. A Mayan girl lived with\n        her family until she found a husband and then she went to live with her\n        new man. Women in the Mayan empire were seen as being subordinate to\n        men. They’re duty was to be good wives, manage the home and bring up the\n        children. Wealthy Mayan women could not inherit money nor were they able\n        to earn money from working.\n        <ProjectImage\n          img={women}\n          alt={'maya women'}\n          cite={'This is a depiction of two high class Mayan women.

It\n        wasn’t. In a caste system upward social mobility is impossible and it\n        was possible for the merchant class to move upward. Furthermore, if it\n        was a caste systems surfs would not have been able to become slaves. The\n        reason why people mistake the Mayan system as a caste system is because\n        there was a huge gap between the king, elites and merchant class and the\n        surfs and slaves. When there’s that huge of a gap and when a society\n        utilizes slavery, it makes upward moblity in the lower classes nearly\n        impossible. The Mayans did have something which was closer to a\n        plutocratic system which means that the wealthy people were extremely\n        wealthy and the poor were extremely poor and even male Mayan surfs had\n        pretty much no say or contribution to overall society.\n      </Container>\n    </GridItem>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default AspectJalaine\n","/Users/owner/Documents/GitHub/cp-maya/src/components/Aspects/AspectMariela.js",["202","203","204","205","206","207","208"],"import React from 'react'\n\nimport {\n  GridItem,\n  Text,\n  Center,\n  Stack,\n  Heading,\n  Image,\n  Box,\n  Container,\n  Avatar,\n} from '@chakra-ui/react'\n\nimport background from '../../images/000017.jpg'\nimport AspectHeader from './AspectHeader'\n\nconst AspectMariela = () => {\n  return (\n    <GridItem colSpan={5}>\n      <AspectHeader\n        title='Agriculture and Warfare'\n        img={background}\n        subt='Maya Agriculture and Warfare'\n        minread={6}\n        name='Mariela Aranda'\n        color='orange'\n      />\n      <Container\n        width={'rem'}\n        maxW={'4xl'}\n        bg={'blackAlpha.20'}\n        rounded={'md'}\n        p={4}\n      ></Container>\n    </GridItem>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default AspectMariela\n","/Users/owner/Documents/GitHub/cp-maya/src/layout/Nav.js",[],"/Users/owner/Documents/GitHub/cp-maya/src/layout/Footer.js",["209","210","211","212","213"],"/Users/owner/Documents/GitHub/cp-maya/src/components/AspectCards/AspectCard.js",[],"/Users/owner/Documents/GitHub/cp-maya/src/components/AspectCards/AspectCardJalaine.js",[],"/Users/owner/Documents/GitHub/cp-maya/src/components/AspectCards/AspectCardMariela.js",[],"/Users/owner/Documents/GitHub/cp-maya/src/components/AspectCards/AspectCardBruce.js",[],"/Users/owner/Documents/GitHub/cp-maya/src/layout/ColorModeSwitcher.js",[],"/Users/owner/Documents/GitHub/cp-maya/src/components/ProjectPage.js",["214","215"],"import React from 'react'\n\nimport {\n  GridItem,\n  Heading,\n  Text,\n  Stack,\n  Center,\n  Box,\n  useBreakpointValue,\n  Image,\n  Divider,\n  Flex,\n  VStack,\n} from '@chakra-ui/react'\n\nimport map from '../images/000005.png'\nimport tikal from '../images/000002.jpg'\nimport pyramids from '../images/000004.jpg'\nimport AspectHeader from './Aspects/AspectHeader'\n\nfunction ProjectPage() {\n  return (\n    <GridItem colStart={1} colSpan={4}>\n      <Center>\n        <Flex\n          h={'40rem'}\n          maxH={'60vw'}\n          maxW={'100vw'}\n          backgroundImage={pyramids}\n          backgroundSize={'cover'}\n          backgroundPosition={'center center'}\n          mb={9}\n        >\n          <VStack\n            w={'full'}\n            justify={'center'}\n            px={useBreakpointValue({ base: 4, md: 8 })}\n            bgGradient={'linear(to-r, blackAlpha.800, transparent)'}\n          >\n            <Center>\n              <Stack\n                ml={6}\n                p={6}\n                direction={'column'}\n                width={'50rem'}\n                maxW={'100vw'}\n              >\n                <Text\n                  color={'primary'}\n                  textTransform={'uppercase'}\n                  fontWeight={800}\n                  fontSize={'sm'}\n                  letterSpacing={1.1}\n                  mr={36}\n                >\n                  Project Website Introduction\n                </Text>\n                <Heading as={'h1'} size={'lg'} color={'whiteAlpha.900'}>\n                  HIS 103 - CGP | <em>The Americas</em>\n                </Heading>\n                <Text\n                  fontWeight={'semibold'}\n                  fontSize={'xl'}\n                  color={'whiteAlpha.900'}\n                >\n                  The Classic Period Maya\n                </Text>\n              </Stack>\n            </Center>\n          </VStack>\n        </Flex>\n      </Center>\n      <Center>\n        <Stack spacing={3} fontWeight={'medium'}>\n          <Box>\n            <Text>\n              The Maya occupied a region of Mesoamerica that includes what is\n              today Guatemala, Belize, the Yucatan Peninsula, and the western\n              portions of Honduras and El Salvador.
