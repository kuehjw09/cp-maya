They\n                  envisioned the dome of the sky as a ‘cosmic mirror’ that\n                  reflected processes on earth. Maya art, architecture, pottery,\n                  and culture was like a mapping of the heavens, and they\n                  recreated their observations of the sky upon the earth.\n                  <br /> <br />\n                  The Maya believed in the idea that life and death were\n                  cyclical processes, and likened them to their understanding of\n                  the seasons, calendars, astronomical, and agricultural cycles.\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  The Mayans made incredibly advanced calendrical systems based\n                  on naked-eye observations of the night sky.

This text was preserved\n                    through oral tradition in the Pre-Colombian era and recorded\n                    in writing by the K’iche’ Maya in 1550 C.E. The Popol Vuh\n                    encompasses a range of subjects that include creation,\n                    ancestry, history, and Maya cosmology. Understanding the\n                    Mayan creation myth allows us to make educated inferences\n                    about what spiritual life and culture was like in their\n                    civilization and better understand the ways in which the\n                    Mayans experienced their world.\n                    <br /> <br />\n                    The text itself has undergone at least 13 different\n                    translations and has been influenced by the Spanish\n                    Catholics that oversaw its commitment to writing, but it\n                    still retains much of its legitimacy as the foundational\n                    creation and mythological narrative of the Maya. There are a\n                    few key ideas we can derive from the Popol Vuh that help us\n                    to see the world as the Maya did, these are the Maya\n                    creation myth, the idea of Xibalba or the “underworld”, and\n                    the description of the Maya universe as being inside a\n                    cyclical process where life, death, and rebirth continually\n                    repeat. The Popol Vuh also introduces us to ideas such as\n                    sacrifice and ancestral energy, which will be important\n                    later in our understanding of Maya ritual life and kingship.\n                    <Heading as={'h3'} size={'md'} py={3}>\n                      The Maya Creation Myth\n                    </Heading>\n                    Part One of the Popol Vuh in the translation by Denis\n                    Tedlock deals with Maya creation.
